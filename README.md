# Movie-Recommendation-Systems-Using-Filtering-Approach

In the rapidly evolving entertainment industry, data-driven insights are crucial for strategic planning and enhancing user engagement. This project tackles the challenge of content discovery by building a Movie Recommendation System that not only improves user experience but also provides valuable analytics for strategic decision-making. By utilizing Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering approaches, the system delivers personalized movie recommendations, offering a deeper understanding of user behavior. Implemented with PySpark and Keras, this project demonstrates how advanced analytics can drive business strategies and optimize content offerings in the entertainment sector.

The system utilizes the MovieLens 100k dataset to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user ratings and preferences. We employed techniques like Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for collaborative filtering, and Softmax DNN for content-based recommendations. The project evaluates different models using metrics such as RMSE, MSE, MAR@K, and Coverage, providing insights into their effectiveness in making accurate and diverse movie recommendations. The system is implemented using PySpark and Keras.
