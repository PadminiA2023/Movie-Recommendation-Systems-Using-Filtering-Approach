# Movie-Recommendation-Systems-Using-Filtering-Approach

In the rapidly evolving entertainment industry, data-driven insights are crucial for strategic planning and enhancing user engagement. This project tackles the challenge of content discovery by building a Movie Recommendation System that not only improves user experience but also provides valuable analytics for strategic decision-making. By utilizing Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering approaches, the system delivers personalized movie recommendations, offering a deeper understanding of user behavior. Implemented with PySpark and Keras, this project demonstrates how advanced analytics can drive business strategies and optimize content offerings in the entertainment sector.

The system utilizes the MovieLens 100k dataset to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user ratings and preferences. We employed techniques like Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for collaborative filtering, and Softmax DNN for content-based recommendations. The project evaluates different models using metrics such as RMSE, MSE, MAR@K, and Coverage, providing insights into their effectiveness in making accurate and diverse movie recommendations. The system is implemented using PySpark and Keras.

Through rigorous testing, the system achieved impressive accuracy, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) scores of 0.88 and 0.78 for the user-based recommendations using ALS, and 0.59 and 0.35 for content-based recommendations using SVD. These results reflect the system’s effectiveness in accurately predicting user preferences. Additionally, the project’s comprehensive evaluation using metrics like MAR@K and Coverage demonstrated that the collaborative filtering model not only had higher recall but also offered a broader range of relevant content, making it a strong tool for content discovery. Beyond enhancing the user experience, the project also provided strategic insights for business analytics. 

By analyzing user behavior and movie characteristics, the system delivers actionable intelligence that can inform strategic decision-making and optimize content offerings in the entertainment sector. The Softmax DNN model, for instance, achieved a 12% coverage, showcasing its capability to recommend a diverse set of movies compared to traditional models, thus highlighting the potential for advanced analytics to drive business strategies.
